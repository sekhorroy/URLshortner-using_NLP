NEW DELHI: Indian cricketers notched up a plethora of records during the first Test against West Indies at the SCA Stadium in Rajkot and the icing on the cake was that the hosts went on to clinch their biggest victory in Test cricket (by innings).


India pulled off an incredible innings and 272 run victory against West Indies inside three days on Saturday. And this triumph is now in fact India's 100th overall Test win at home which was registered in their 266th match.

India dominated the game, amassing 649 for nine in their first innings before bowling out the West Indies twice on day three, to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.

The Windies were bundled out for 181 in 48 overs before lunch and were asked to follow-on. They did not fare any better in the second innings, crumbling to 196 all out in 50.5 overs in the final session. 

In the process, India also became the fourth team to get to 100 victories at home after Australia, England and South Africa. Australia top the list with 238 wins out of 415 matches ahead of England's 217 in 515 Tests. South Africa feature third on the list with 104 victories in 230 matches.

Having played their maiden Test at home in 1933/34 against England, it took India close to two decades to record their first victory on home soil. India clinched an innings and 8 run win against England in 1952 for their first home Test win.
